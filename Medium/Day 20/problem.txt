Consider a grid with h rows and w columns of squares. Let (r,c) denote the square at the r-th row from the top and the c-th column from the left. 
Each square is painted black or white.
The grid is said to be good if and only if the following condition is satisfied:
From (1,1), we can reach (h,w) by moving one square right or down repeatedly, while always being on a white square.
Note that (1,1) and (h,w) must be white if the grid is good.

Your task is to make the grid good by repeating the operation below. 

Choose four integers r0, c0, r1, c1 (1 ≤ r0 ≤ r1 ≤ h, 1 ≤ c0 ≤ c1 ≤ w). 
For each pair r,c (r0 ≤ r ≤ r1, c0 ≤ c ≤ c1), invert the color of (r, c) - that is, from white to black and vice versa.

Find the minimum number of operations needed to complete the task. It can be proved that you can always complete the task in a finite number of operations.

Input:
First line of input contains two integers h and w (2 <= h, w <= 100).
The next h line contains w integers - value at grid (i, j).
