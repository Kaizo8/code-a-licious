You are given n questions and you've to answer all questions.
Initially, you have x points. Each time you answer a question, you gain 1 point if your answer is correct and loses 1 point if it is incorrect.
However, there is an exception: when you have 0 points, you lose nothing for answering a question incorrectly.
You will be given a string s representing whether your answers are correct.
If the i-th character of s from the left is o, it means your answer for the 
i-th question is correct; if that character is x, it means his answer for the i-th question is incorrect.
How many points will you have in the end?
